        <h1> <strong>Hi!</strong></h1>
       
        <p class="helvetica" >I’m Alessandra, I’m Italian and have been living in NY for almost six years.
I studied illustration in Rome, lived in Milano and Cape Town.
While in Southafrica my job was to draw children’s books for an international publisher, and it’s been there that my desire to move to the US took ground in my imagination. I was lucky enough to wn te Green Card Lottery and I’m very happy and proud to be a US Citizen since last April.
That visa enabled me to move to the states and work here as a freelancer.
In NY, during the first months, I was still working with the South African publisher. Then I was lucky to find an ad agency that, being pretty small, gave me the opportunity to participate on several projects wearing multiple hats, as a graphic designer, illustrator and art director.
The agency then decided to join with another. I continued doing storyboards and some illustrations mainly through an agent with whom I’ve been working for the following years.  I happened to be drawing storyboards for some beauty and fashion commercials and that made me realize I do have a passion for it as for video making.
<em>I decided to get back to study in order to learn new skills geared towards art direction.</em>
