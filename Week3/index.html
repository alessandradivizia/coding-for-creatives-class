        <h2><font color="white">Art Direction</font></h2>

        <p class="helvetica" >My interest towards developing interesting concepts and contents while solving clients' problems fostered in me the desire to develop my <em>art direction</em> skills.

</p>

  <p class="helvetica" >The love for <em>illustration</em>, as oil paintings and art in general has always been a very strong motivator in my choices and i am willing to continue pursuing that combined with art direction.
</p>

  <p class="helvetica" >The recent rediscovery of Typhography and Graphic design thought me to see them as one of the highest artistic expressions of the human kind, as it can be uniting utility with some incredibly pleasurable forms and shapes  </p>

<p class="helvetica" ><em><strong>I decided to get back to study in order to learn new skills geared towards art direction.</em>
</strong></p>
 
        <h2><strong><font color="white"> Why i'm here: </font></strong> </h2>    
        <p class="helvetica" >The goal for me is to master more of conceptual, technical, presentation and teamwork skills in order to become an awarded art director and in the future creative director. <br>
I also want to meet as many people as possible as I felt I was missing it during the years I did storyboards.


     <h3><strong><font color="white">And so...</font></h3>
<p class="helvetica" >Pleasure meeting you and I do look forward to learning more about your company so to do amazing work together! </p>
